    "mission": "The Israel Guide Dog Center for the Blind began operations on January 1, 1991 with just one objective -- to help blind people in Israel to achieve independence and mobility through the use of guide dogs. The mission of the Israel Guide Dog Center for the Blind is to improve the quality of life of blind people by providing them with safe mobility, independence and self-confidence through the faithful assistance of guide dogs. Israel has over 24,000 registered blind people, although unofficial estimates place this figure much higher. Of these, about 250 are guide dog assisted, but this number is growing steadily as the number of graduates from the Center increases annually.<br><br>In 2013 we formalized our Special Needs Companion program, where we give dogs that are not selected for guide dog training to people in need. Our largest group are children with autism, followed by soldiers with PTSD, children with blindness, or others with Special Needs. All of our dogs go on to help someone!",
